```{r}

penguins <- read_csv("lter_penguin_species.csv")

```

Here we explored the potential for predicting penguin mass in Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins considering flipper length, sex, and species. We used data recorded at Palmer Station, LTER, Antarctica, compiled from the Environmental Data Initative (Gorman 2017).

```{r, include = FALSE}
penguins_relationships <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c("FEMALE", "MALE")) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "FEMALE" ~ "Female",
                         sex == "MALE" ~ "Male")) %>% 
  select(species, 
         sex,
         flipper_length_mm,
         body_mass_g)

***Figure 1.** Penguin species, sex, flipper length, and body mass. Data was recorded at Palmer Station, LTER, Antarctica and compiled from the Environmental Data Initiative (Gorman 2017)*

**Key Takeaways**

- There appears to be a positive correlation between body mass and flipper length among both sexes in all species. This makes sense intuitively, as both likely increase with penguin overall size (i.e. height). 
- Gentoo penguins are the largest in terms of both body mass and flipper length. Chinstrap and adelie penguins are similar to each other in these regards, though it is difficult to determine how similar due to relatively less data for Gentoo penguins. 
- In all three species, males tend to have a larger body mass and longer flipper length than females.

# Our data appears linear and conceptually would make sense to be linear. So, let's see how a multi linear regression model works. 

## Multi linear regression model

penguins_lm <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species + sex, data = penguins_relationships)
  
penguins_lm
summary(penguins_lm)

# Flipper length, sex, species: 
# Mass = -365.82 + 20.03(Flipper Length) - 87.63(Chinstrap) + 836.26(Gentoo) + 530.38(Male)
# R2 = 0.8669

penguins_lm_2 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ species + sex, data = penguins_relationships)

summary(penguins_lm_2)

# Sex, species:
# Mass = -3372.39 + 26.92(Chinstrap) + 1377.86(Gentoo) + 667.56(Male)
# R2 = 0.8468

penguins_lm_3 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data = penguins_relationships)

penguins_lm_3
summary(penguins_lm_3)

# Flipper length, species:
# Mass = -4013.18 + 40.61(Flipper Length) -205.38(Chinstrap) + 284.52(Gentoo)
# R2 = 0.787

# Let's look at the AIC values...

AIC(penguins_lm)
# AIC = 4740.774  

AIC(penguins_lm_2)
# AIC = 4785.594

AIC(penguins_lm_3)
# AIC = 4895.267

# Thinking conceptually about these predictor variables, collinearity and interaction among terms are not an issue.

## penguins_lm (flipper length, sex, species) has the highest R2 value, lowest AIC value, AND makes the most sense conceptually (and considering our scatter plot), so we will go with that one.

# Check if assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity are satisfied

plot(penguins_lm)

# In residuals vs fitted, we see that the data mostly follows our assumptions. We can also see that the data is clearly grouped, likely by species or sex. We can also see here that the residuals don't seem to be correlated to each other. 
# QQ plot is beautifully linear! Linearity between actual and estimated values. Yay! 

```


We checked whether our model satisfies the assumption of homoscedasticity (constant variance) with a plot of residuals vs fitted values. The residuals appeared even on each side of the horizontal line, and therefore satisfy this assumption. In this plot, we can also see the data seems grouped (horizontally), likely due to differences among species and sex.  

We checked whether the residuals are normally distributed with a QQ plot. The QQ plot demonstrated a linear relationship, which confirms the residuals are normally distributed.

Our adjusted R^2^, or coefficient of determination, of 0.865 means that 86.5% of the variance in penguin body mass is predictable from penguin flipper length, species, and sex. 

- **Flipper Length**: we expect body mass to be 20.03g *more* on average for each 1mm increase in flipper length, if all other variables remain the same.
- **Species, Chinstrap**: we expect Chinstrap penguins to weigh 87.63g on average *less* than Adelie penguins, if all other variables remain the same. 
- **Species, Gentoo**: we expect Gentoo penguins to weigh 836.26g, on average, *more* than Adelie penguins, if all other variables remain the same.
- **Sex, Male**: we expect male penguins to weigh 530.38g, on average, *more* than female penguins, if all other variables remain the same.

## Task 2. Smoking effects on baby birth weight


```{r}

birthweights <- read_csv("nc_birthweights.csv") %>%
  select("tpounds", "lowbw", "smoke")

```

We analyzed the relationship between birth weight and whether women reported smoking during pregnancy by reviewing the proportions (Table 3) and testing significance with a chi-square test for independence. Birth weights were defined as low (below 5lb 8oz) or not low and responses to whether mothers smoked were categorized as yes or no. The data used was released by the state of North Carolina in 2004.

***Table 3.** Proportions and counts for low (< 5lb 8oz) and not low birth weights born to mothers who reported that they smoked or did not smoke during pregnancy. The data used was released by the state of North Carolina in 2004.*

```{r}

# Get the counts

birthweights_counts <- birthweights %>% 
  filter(smoke %in% c(0, 1)) %>% 
  count(lowbw, smoke) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = lowbw, values_from = n) %>% 
   rename("Not Low Birth Weight" = "0",
         "Low Birth Weight" = "1")

# Making a table of proportions with janitor::adorn

birthweights_props <- birthweights_counts %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front") %>% 
  mutate(" " = case_when(
           smoke == "0" ~ "Did Not Smoke",
           smoke == "1" ~ "Smoked")) 

birthweights_props <- birthweights_props[, c(4, 2, 3, 1)] %>% 
  select(" ",
         "Not Low Birth Weight",
         "Low Birth Weight")

kable(birthweights_props,
      align = 'c') %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "hover")

```


```{r, include = FALSE}

# Chi-square test for independence

# Are the proportions within different levels in a group so different across multiple groups that we actually think there's an effect of group? Are birth weight and smoking independent? 

birthweights_chi_counts <- birthweights_counts %>% 
  select(-smoke)

birthweights_chi <- chisq.test(birthweights_chi_counts)

birthweights_chi 

# p = 0.27, we did not detect a significant difference in birth weight (normal or low) for people who smoked and did not smoke during pregnancy. 

# There is not a significant association between birth weight and smoking during pregnancy for the levels analyzed.

```


Both mothers that did not report smoking and that did had the majority of births at not low birth weight (`r birthweights_props$"Not Low Birth Weight"[1]` and `r birthweights_props$"Not Low Birth Weight"[2]`, respectively). We did not find a siginificant association between birth weight and smoking during pregnancy for the levels analyzed ($\chi^2$ (`r birthweights_chi$parameter`) = `r round(birthweights_chi$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(birthweights_chi$p.value, 2)`).


This data may contain biases associated with the survey methods; for example, due to social pressure or errors in hindsight women may be inclined to claim that they did not smoke during pregnancy even if they did. Offering a Likert Scale would not only provide more data, but could also lessen this bias associated with a strict yes or no questionnaire.

We compared the percentage of white and minority students of total UCSB undergraduate students from 2008-2018 to demonstrate how the relative proportions are changing over time (Figure 2). Data is compiled from the annual UCSB Campus Profiles prepared by the Office of Budget and Planning through the Institutional Research, Planning, & Assessment Initiative (UCSB). This dataset includes graduate and undergraduate students; however, we only used data for undergraduate students. Additionally, this dataset provides data for eight categories of ethnicities; however, to simplify for our purposes, we grouped the two categories with the smallest proportions of the total (American Indian / Alaskan students and E. Indian / Pakistani) within the 'Other' category. Lastly, again to simplify, we titled the Asian / Pacific Islander category as 'Asian', but this category still includes Pacific Islander students.

***Figure 3.** Percentages of white and minority UCSB Undergraduate Students (2008-2018). The category titled 'Asian' includes Asian and Pacific Islander students. The majority of the students within the category titled 'Other' are American Indian / Alaskan students and E. Indian / Pakistani students. Data is compiled from the annual UCSB Campus Profiles prepared by the Office of Budget and Planning through the Institutional Research, Planning, & Assessment Initiative (UCSB). The format of this graph was inspired by [work from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/18/u-s-public-schools-expected-to-be-majority-minority-starting-this-fall/).*  

**Key Takeaways**

- At UCSB from 2008-2010, the percentage of white undergraduate students was higher than the percentage of all minority undergraduate students combined (>50%). 
- In 2011, the percentage of white undergraduate students was lower than the percentage of collective minority undergraduate students for the first time (in this data set). The percentage of collective minority students continued to increase 2011-2018.
- Much of the increase in the percentage of collective minority students is due to an increase in the percentage of Asian and Chicanx students. The percentage of Asian and Chicanx students increased by 7.9% and 6.0% from 2008 to 2018, respectively.


## Task 4. Purple urchins on the Santa Barbara coast

We explored size distributions of purple sea urchins (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*) at five sites along the Santa Barbara coast. The data is from SBC LTER long-term kelp removal experiment sites (Reed 2019). We only examined data from control treatments, where no kelp was removed.

**Key Takeaways**

- Mean urchin sizes and size distributions are very similar at Isla Visa, Carpinteria, and Naples, and only slightly larger at Arroyo Quemado.

- Mean urchin size is the largest at Mohawk. Mean urchin size at Mohawk is ~1.25cm more than at the site with the smallest mean urchin size, Naples, and ~ 0.75cm more than at the next largest site, Arroyo Quemado.

We analyzed observations for purple urchin size from 2008-2018 at all five sites (see Table 4 for means and standard deviations for each of the five sites). One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD revealed a significant difference in mean urchin size across all five sites (F(`r round(urchin_aov_outputs$outputs[1], 2)`, 14940) =  `r round(urchin_aov_outputs$outputs[7], 2)`, *p* < 0.001 for all pair-wise comparisons). Table 5 provides a summary of the differences in mean urchin size (cm) among the pair-wise comparisons. 


***Table 5**. Differences in mean purple urchin size (cm) in among pair-wise comparisons from five sites along the Santa Barbara Coast (2008-2018) calculated in a post-hoc Tukey's HSD analysis. Size varied significantly among all sites (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Rows are listed from largest to smallest mean urchin size and columns are listed from smallest to largest (see Table 4 for mean urchin sizes). Data is provided by SBC LTER (Reed 2019).*
