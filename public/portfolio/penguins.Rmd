Here we explored the potential for predicting penguin mass in Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins considering flipper length, sex, and species. We used data recorded at Palmer Station, LTER, Antarctica, compiled from the Environmental Data Initative (Gorman 2017).

penguins <- read_csv("lter_penguin_species.csv")

```{r, include = FALSE}
penguins_relationships <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c("FEMALE", "MALE")) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(sex == "FEMALE" ~ "Female",
                         sex == "MALE" ~ "Male")) %>% 
  select(species, 
         sex,
         flipper_length_mm,
         body_mass_g)

**Key Takeaways**

- There appears to be a positive correlation between body mass and flipper length among both sexes in all species. This makes sense intuitively, as both likely increase with penguin overall size (i.e. height). 
- Gentoo penguins are the largest in terms of both body mass and flipper length. Chinstrap and adelie penguins are similar to each other in these regards, though it is difficult to determine how similar due to relatively less data for Gentoo penguins. 
- In all three species, males tend to have a larger body mass and longer flipper length than females. 


```{r, include = FALSE}

# Our data appears linear and conceptually would make sense to be linear. So, let's see how a multi linear regression model works. 

## Multi linear regression model

penguins_lm <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species + sex, data = penguins_relationships)
  
penguins_lm
summary(penguins_lm)

# Flipper length, sex, species: 
# Mass = -365.82 + 20.03(Flipper Length) - 87.63(Chinstrap) + 836.26(Gentoo) + 530.38(Male)
# R2 = 0.8669

penguins_lm_2 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ species + sex, data = penguins_relationships)

penguins_lm_2
summary(penguins_lm_2)

# Sex, species:
# Mass = -3372.39 + 26.92(Chinstrap) + 1377.86(Gentoo) + 667.56(Male)
# R2 = 0.8468

penguins_lm_3 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + species, data = penguins_relationships)

penguins_lm_3
summary(penguins_lm_3)

# Flipper length, species:
# Mass = -4013.18 + 40.61(Flipper Length) -205.38(Chinstrap) + 284.52(Gentoo)
# R2 = 0.787

# Let's look at the AIC values...

AIC(penguins_lm)
# AIC = 4740.774  

AIC(penguins_lm_2)
# AIC = 4785.594

AIC(penguins_lm_3)
# AIC = 4895.267

# Thinking conceptually about these predictor variables, collinearity and interaction among terms are not an issue.

## penguins_lm (flipper length, sex, species) has the highest R2 value, lowest AIC value, AND makes the most sense conceptually (and considering our scatter plot), so we will go with that one.

                               "Sex: Male",
                               "Constant"))

```

</center>

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Check if assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity are satisfied

plot(penguins_lm)

# In residuals vs fitted, we see that the data mostly follows our assumptions. We can also see that the data is clearly grouped, likely by species or sex. We can also see here that the residuals don't seem to be correlated to each other. 
# QQ plot is beautifully linear! Linearity between actual and estimated values. Yay! 

```


We checked whether our model satisfies the assumption of homoscedasticity (constant variance) with a plot of residuals vs fitted values. The residuals appeared even on each side of the horizontal line, and therefore satisfy this assumption. In this plot, we can also see the data seems grouped (horizontally), likely due to differences among species and sex.  

We checked whether the residuals are normally distributed with a QQ plot. The QQ plot demonstrated a linear relationship, which confirms the residuals are normally distributed.

Our adjusted R^2^, or coefficient of determination, of 0.865 means that 86.5% of the variance in penguin body mass is predictable from penguin flipper length, species, and sex. 

- **Flipper Length**: we expect body mass to be 20.03g *more* on average for each 1mm increase in flipper length, if all other variables remain the same.
- **Species, Chinstrap**: we expect Chinstrap penguins to weigh 87.63g on average *less* than Adelie penguins, if all other variables remain the same. 
- **Species, Gentoo**: we expect Gentoo penguins to weigh 836.26g, on average, *more* than Adelie penguins, if all other variables remain the same.
- **Sex, Male**: we expect male penguins to weigh 530.38g, on average, *more* than female penguins, if all other variables remain the same.
